# CGSC2021 (CodinGame Spring Challenge 2021)

This contest was my third, I had not alot of time to work on it because I was working during the week. My final code brought me to gold league, global rank 837th/6867.

## How I worked

I coded in Python3, trying to be as concise as possible, abusing OOP.
There are some dirty stuffs lying around, this is definitely not my cleanest code.
The whole bot is heuristic, based on observations of how well my bot performed against the others.

I made a simulation attempt based on BFS, but it did not work out.
From what I read, best players were using things like Monte Carlo Tree Search, or even Neural Network.
